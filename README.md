# AnalyTeam - Beer Reviews Dataset

## Title: Beer reviewers Categorization 

## Abstract: (A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?)
Can we categorize user behavior/personalities with meaningful boundaries and extract trends from these groups? Using the beer review dataset, we want to extract relevant features in order to catagorize the users into some personnality classes, like *Adventurer*, *Free-thinker*, *Conformist*, *Beer-lover*, *Hard-to-please*,*Like the expert* ... 

## Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
* How do we classify users?
* Why is this classification backed up by data?
* Why is this classification useful to understand the different types of user/useful for the site to categorize them? For example if a reviewer always give really higher rating than the average indicate it with a badge on their review called “Beer-lover”.
* What trends can we extract from these different classification of users?
