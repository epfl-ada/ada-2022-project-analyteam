text: From a bottle, pours a piss yellow color with a fizzy white head.  This is carbonated similar to soda.The nose is basic.. malt, corn, a little floral, some earthy straw.  The flavor is boring, not offensive, just boring.  Tastes a little like corn and grain.  Hard to write a review on something so simple.Its ok, could be way worse.

text: Pours pale copper with a thin head that quickly goes. Caramel, golden syrup nose. Taste is big toasty, grassy hops backed by dark fruit, candy corn and brack malts. Clingy. Dries out at the end with more hops. Brave, more going on that usual for this type.

text: 500ml Bottle bought from The Vintage, Antrim...Poured a golden yellow / orange colour... White head poured quite thick and foamy and faded to thin layer...Aroma - Fruity (burnt orange, some apple hints), light maltiness, spicy hops, vanilla, some sea saltiness...Taste - Spicy / peppery hop notes, citrusy, light sweetness, grassy, slight creaminess, some bready notes...Feel - Quite sharp and pretty dry. Light body.... Pretty drinkable...Overall - A pretty good beer.... worth a try...

text: Serving: 500ml brown bottlePour: Good head with excellent retention and a slight amount of lacing Appearance: Slightly cloudy golden colour. Smell: Very subtle sweet smell, nothing too distinct comes throughFlavour: Subtle bitter flavour, slight taste of fresh hay. Nice hoppy flavours. Like the smell, no real distinct flavours come through. Overall: Quite a refreshing brew. Nicely balanced. Nice to see a local brewery producing quality beers like this one and long may it continue! Looking forward to trying more of Strangfords brews.
