text: From a bottle, pours a piss yellow color with a fizzy white head.  This is carbonated similar to soda.The nose is basic.. malt, corn, a little floral, some earthy straw.  The flavor is boring, not offensive, just boring.  Tastes a little like corn and grain.  Hard to write a review on something so simple.Its ok, could be way worse.
review: True
