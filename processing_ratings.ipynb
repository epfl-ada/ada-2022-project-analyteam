Medium, some cling, crisp, some oil. exp 14 June 2012. Brewer's Gold, Chinook, Centennial, Cascade and roasted malt.One of the darkest BIPAs I've seen. I let this one go a bit too long, so I don't know what that did for the hops. (Then again, why the clear glass for an IPA?) At any rate, still plenty of Centennial citrus with measured roast. A restrained yet American take on the style, not too bitter from roast or hops and very drinkable, from a brewer who guested at Bridgeport.\n",

Bottle No. 04543 (July 2009).A: Peeling back the foil and pouring, I see a dark brown beer than grows darker the more liquid I add. A slowly rising brown head eventually attains considerable height, then fades back down into quiescence, leaving solid creamy lacing in its wake. The beer is blackish-brown now, near to the colour of motor oil, as it claims.S: Mmm. It smells like an imperial stout. Light roasted or chocolate malts. Traces of dark, delicious coffee are met with oaken overtones carrying the unmistakable scent of whisky and the expected whiffs of vanilla. I am entranced for a few moments, trying to work out the aromas of one of my favourite whiskies (Highland Park 12). A direct comparison reveals that Ola Dubh preserves very little of the peatiness of Highland Park, but does hold on to the honey sweetness. Any fruit in the Highland Park has become less rich and more zesty in Harviestoun's beer.T: Very, very nice. Sturdy, but sweet -- in two different ways. One is the anticipated round, malty sweetness. The other is altogether different and must be from the whisky casks -- fruity, alcoholic, almost spicy. This is the more delicious of the two. Towards the end of the taste, drier flavours begin to emerge -- hops and toasted malts. The aftertaste is clean, only light bitter, and tapers off gently, but sooner than I'd like. I wish I could taste this beer for hours.M: Oily, with cheeky carbonation. Smooth and refreshing.D: Absolutely no problem drinking this one -- it's a pleasure. Ola Dubh is engaging, exciting, and exceptional. Mmm; moreish. Definitely recommended.Notes: Paired with the recommended Comté. Initially, I don't really see the appeal, but, after consideration, it does seem to bring out an enjoyable spiciness. &quot;Leading cheese expert&quot; Paul Thomas claims that the Gruyère should &quot;accentuate the whisky notes on the finish,&quot; and -- I'll be darned -- it does!\n",

(It's been stored on the top shelf of a closet for a couple of months, cool with light exposure.) I am discouraged, but not dissuaded. Like AB:04, I had a devil of a time extracting the cork. Upon finally uncorking, beer spewed everywhere, dousing my desk in a wonderfully fruity smelling nectar. The beer itself is ruddy amber, with a thin head (after the fizz faded), persistent bubbles, and diffuse sediment. The center is darker than the golden-orange edges.S: Very berry. Raspberry, strawberry, boysenberry, etc. completely dominate the aroma. Sweet and sugary, it smells more like candy than beer. Really nice.T: Uhh...Not my favourite, but crazy-interesting. Pretty much what you smell is what you get -- lots of tart, fruity berriness. Honestly, it tastes a bit like puréed raspberries. More sour than sweet, to my disappointment. The sourness is akin to a lambic beer, and I suspect that B. lambicus played some role in this creation. Although AB:03 grows on me, the aftertaste is unpleasantly bitter -- very similar to citrus peel. Just concentrate on the berryburst of a maintaste, and take another sip whenever the fruit fades.M: At times, thin; sour-dry; and not enough carbonation in my opinion (although perhaps mine escaped as soon as I opened the bottle?).D: Compulsively sippable, although mostly to re-grasp the ephemeral berry perfection that peaks in the first half of the taste and forget the latter half. I'm really glad I tried this one -- although I feel it was a tad over-priced -- but I couldn't recommend it in good conscience. I will not be having another, even were they able to be obtained.\n",

Bottle 2612/3300, bottled 1 November 2010.A: A nicely-designed, corked bottle, which isn't as stubby as it looks in the photo. ...And I can't get the cork out. Due to the design of the bottle and cork, a normal corkscrew is ineffective, and my Swiss army knife -- usually so reliable -- has also failed me. When I finally get it open, through sheer brute strength, it pours a nutty dark-brown with a reddish tone. High, fizzy head has an unmistakeable orange hue. The head fizzles down into absolutely nothing, but some carbonation can still be seen disturbing the surface.S: Um...chillies. It smells eye-wateringly of cayenne, habanero or something even hotter (BA bobsy says it's naga pepper). Fortunately, I love spicy things, because this makes my scalp tingle. Perhaps a hint of something alcoholic sweet, but it's hard to concentrate with the chilli in the way. Even though it's a bit one-dimensional, high marks for being strong, completely unexpected, and pleasing (at least to me).T: Wowzers! Very odd. And hard to describe. A sizzling elixir; a pleasant concoction. Sweeter than it has any right to be, this Abstraktion is fruity (raspberry?), strong, and full of chilli flavours without the heat. The aftertaste has some coffee beans, but can't manage any bitterness; tobacco nots as well. By the end, the initially-pleasant sweetness risks becoming cloying. Hot peppers go in and out throughout the (after)taste.M: Sometimes smooth and pleasant, at times sticking at the back of the throat, at others, burning vigorously throughout the mouth. Incredibly full of flavour, perhaps more akin to food than beer. Definitely fun.D: As much as I like this beer, it's not particularly drinkable. Don't get me wrong, I'm really enjoying it, but it's not an experience I'd feel able to repeat anytime soon...and by that time, it will presumably be unfindable. Enjoyable? Yes. Interesting? Absolutely. Good? *I* think so. Recommended? I haven't a clue.Notes: I experimentally paired this with an Ecudoran dark chocolate with chillies. The beer may have improved the chocolate, but not I'm sure the chocolate improved the beer. The rich cacao is an entirely different sweetness from the somewhat tart-fruity character of the AB:04, but the peppers in the beer bring out the spiciness of the chocolate.\n",

However, here there are some citrus or berry (BrewDog tasting notes suggest blackberry, which I think nails it) tones as well. Interesting, but not my favourite hop scent.T: It tastes much like smells, the result of having loads of the single hops, I suppose -- it dominates both flavour and taste.

A collaborative effort with Three Floyds. &quot;Barrel aged Scottish barley wine.&quot;A: A moderately-forceful pour results in almost two fingers of off-white which churns slowly and shrinks quickly. The beer is a mahongany brown, just barely clear. Good lacing.S: I was confused by the smell until I place peat (as if from whisky) as the now-obvious king of the aroma. It's not not the strongest scent, but the most recongisable and captivating. There are also some sweetish hops, complemented by fruit (overripe grapefruit?). There also seems to be a vanilla undertone, although after looking at the label, I suspect this is rather the added toffee. Complicated and always interesting.T: Weird as hell. But tasty. Just as all-over-the-place and complex as the smell, with most of the constituent ingredients. At first, an alcoholic-packed punch of raw (piney?) hops hits, quickly followed by a startling sweetness containing both toffee and whisky. Focusing on the pleasant barrel-aging, peated barley makes a brief, but unmissable, appearance -- smoke comes out of nowhere, then leaves as abruptly as it came. The aftertaste is lazily long, largely hoppy/bitter, but with a distinctive ashiness I've come to associate with certain Islay malts (less Jura and more Port Charlotte PC8). Odd to find in a beer, though this is just an odd beer all-around. Sheer power of flavour (and my fondness for Islay whisky) bumps my rating up a notch.M: Nothing really special here, other than a drying peat. The warmer the beer, the peatier it gets. I like this.O: It definitely lacks focus, but that's not necessarily a bad thing -- by the same token, Bitch Please is incredibly multi-dimensional. Fortunately, none of the individual facets are unpleasant.

Vanilla, likely from the oak barrels, but also soft alcohol. This whisky cask is over thirty years old, so perhaps its no surprise that it doesn't make more of a mark. Lightly spiced fruit, fruit that reminds me of Speyside.T: And lo and behold, this beer tastes remarkably like a watered-down, less boozy Speyside whisky.

I actually just zoned out and didn't write anything or take a sip for about three minutes; I got distracted by sniffing the Paradox over and over. Dry smoke, whiskyesque phenol, typical Islay. Man, I hope the taste doesn't let me down.T/M: Hrm. Well, it's not quite a letdown, but I suspect maybe this beer is genuinely past its prime. That said, it's still darn good. The initial flavour burst is thoroughly whiskyish, so if you don't like, say, Arbdeg (too light to be Laphroaig, not sweet enough to be, for instance, Lagavulin or JW Black) or, I suppose, Caol Ila, stay way. However, as the whisky-beer mellows, the alcohol becomes secondary and the jarring phenol that charactises the Islay malts I hold so dear settles into a more familiar rhythm. A lot like a rauchbier in character -- smoked meats, dry wood, soft malts. The flavours are excellent, if muted. Spicy-smoky sweetness on the maintaste as the stout rests on the tongue with convincing weight and lacks oppression. The endtaste is bitter (roasted malt and whole coffee beans), dry (peat), and almost (but not quite) chalky (oak?). Little to no carbonation, resulting in a beer that is, if anything, a bit too smooth.O: An excellent beer, one I'm very glad I lucked into. I bought a six-pack, semi-accidentally, for about $20 (including tax) in Athens, Georgia. If you find any floating around, grab some (and maybe even ask for a discount as they're two years &quot;out of date). Highly recommended. Will drink again, and probably not wait too long to do so.\n",

The label says &quot;imperial stout aged in a former Bowmore 1998 cask.&quot;A: A faint forthy head is more than I've seen yet on any of these old Paradox beers. Black walnut; largely opaque. Touch of lacing.S: Whisky and wood (oak). Strong, with peaty phenol and vanilla bean. The Scottish pedigree is obvious.T/M: Vanilla-sweet and creamy-smooth. Not as thin as other three-year-old Paradox beers. Substantial; appealing. The maintaste contains roasted barley, smoky vanilla, thin strands of alcohol, and subtle berries buried in the dark beer. The aftertaste is reminiscent of the ashy finish of an Islay malt (Bruichladdich comes to mind, but that's just me). Complex and rewarding.O: This is a well-crafted Imperial Stout that has stood the test of time. It benefited significantly from barrel-aging in the young Bowmore casks. Highly recommended it you can find any. My favourite so far of the Paradox series. I would drink again (but of course!).\n",

T/M: Thin (old?) but perfectly palatable. An almost creamy sweetness fades slowly into a more noticeably smoky finish. Malt-heavy, with a touch of oaky dryness. Light, chalky, roasted bitterness on the aftertaste reminds me of dark chocolate. The mouthfeel isn't exactly thin as...flat? Insubstantial? It's the most disappointing facet of this Paradox, but I suppose my fair dues for being so late to the party.O: Overall, a good beer that hasn't aged remarkably well. Increasingly whiskyish as I drink more of it, especially the finish. Very bourbon sweet-strong. I wouldn't go out and buy one again, but I'm glad I had one and the price ($3.49) seems reasonable.

A small whiff of peat is probably just my wishful thinking.T: Much lighter than expected. As recommended, I poured this at room temperature, but I'm not sure it did the beer any favours. The weakly carbonated body isn't very robust, nor is the flavour. Bitter chocolate dominates the taste until the end, when a glimmer of whisky shines through. Honestly, I expected more whisky character from six months in the barrel. I know and like Springbank, but I can only detect its presence right around the edges. Following a welcome warmth, the aftertaste is dry, pleasantly bitter, slightly smoky, and of medium duration.M: Thin, but what is present is good.D: Not the best effort, and not recommended at room temperature (next time I'll try around 50 degrees Fahrenheit). But still, an enjoyable experience. I think I will try other bottlings of the Paradox to see if I can find a batch more suited to my tastes.

Grapefruit citrus dances in the background, leaving no doubt that this is an American hop.

It's way better than I expected! Not too harsh, but sweet, with caramel and strong honey. Massive malts more than balance the hop bitterness.

Some sparse sticky lacing.S: Mellow hops are foremost, complementing a sweet fruitiness, leaning towards citrus but not quite making it. Almost molasses in character?T: Mmmm. The molasses character carries over -- not entirely sweet. Complex. Both beautifully bitter and balanced. Hops spiral dizzyingly through the taste married to a light-handed citrus that seems the pre-ordained spouse. Malts are most prominent in the beginning and end of the flavour, but they demand the tongues full attention. The aftertaste is astoundingly delicious and bumps the score up a notch. Starting out wet and sweet, it segues seamlessly into a drier, hoppy bitterness that I wish would last hours. Wow.M: Again, perfect balance. The bittersweet battle is almost overshadowed in excellence by just enough carbonation to liven things up and the wondrous effects on the tongue produced by the presence of massive hops.D: Another rousing classic (in this case, &quot;an historic 1868 IPA&quot;) from Luckie Ales and a damn good IPA. The best I've had from the UK at any rate. Smooth and lush, it's a pleasure to drink. Absolutely recommended.Notes: &quot;This is a reproduction of a beer brewed by the Victorian brewer George Stewart Amsinck (7.3% ABV, 220 IBU). He used vast quantities of aroma hops and pale malt to create an IPA, which would withstand the hot, rough ship's journey to the colonies. This beer is properly matured for 12 months and would benefit from a six months journey in a ship's hold - preferably through the tropics.&quot;\n",

Reviewed 27 May 2011.I bought this beer some months earlier for my girlfriend's visit, since I loved the 8.1% version so much. When referencing my earlier review, I realised this was a different recipe and that the listed ABVs differed.A: No head to speak of. Beautiful tracing on the surface. Dark brown, muddy, and opaque. Translucent in the direct back lighting.S: Sweet fruit, faint spices, rummy alcohol. Raisins, stewed apples, blackberry jam. T: Newer, fresher, and more vibrant than expected. A bit sour, a bit of yeast(?), and maybe even some cinnamon. The aftertaste is faintly dry, with a bit of bitter hops. Malty-sweet with a lot of raw sugars with the fruit. Quite grapey.M: A bit thin, but smooth and pleasant.O: Not as good as the other Edinburgh 68/- (8.1%). Still, Luckie Ales continues to impress. Maybe it's better young.\n",

Apple is present, but there is a wonderful alcoholic sweetness supporting it more reminiscent of figs and caramelised sugar. The brewery claims &quot;crystallized sugars and sweet dried fruits,&quot; an apt enough summary. The body isn't heavy, but the flavour is immense. A bit of spice (cinnamon comes to mind) and a spritely carbonation. The aftertaste is drying and lightly bitter, with unexpected hops and a roastiness.M: Fun and surprising. Light, but rich. Teasing, but firm.D: A really wonderful beer. To be honest, I picked this one because it was local, strong, and unreviewed. I will definitely pick up another bottle and work my way through Luckie Ales' selections.Notes: The label bears the tagline, &quot;As brewed in 1885,&quot; and the website expounds, &quot;This is a reincarnation of the 68/- (8.1% ABV, 48 IBU) brewed by Ushers of Edinburgh in 1885.&quot;\n",

      "text_inp:  Poured from a 33cL bottle into a pint glass.A: A big, fat head fills the glass briefly, before churning back in on itself and settling into patches on the beer's seemingly-viscous surface. Some bubbles, presumably another result of my vigorous pour, disturb the surface. This export stout is a dense dark-brown, opaque, and portly.S: I smell...raisins? Sweet, dark fruit with some alcohol, some hops, and some roasted barley (in roughly descending order of magnitude). Very nice, but not quite what I expected.T: Rather delicate flavours. Any roasted malt comes through only as lightly burnt toast. A brief flowering of fruit (apples, this time) is nipped in the bud by a hoppy presence -- interesting, but somewhat astringent. The hops, however, don't dominate, but eventually lose ground to the sweet maltiness. The end of the taste has happy hints of dark chocolate, and the aftertaste is round, wet, and more bitter than not.M: Light body, with carbonation present. Alcoholic fruits are in the feel, as is a nutty bitterness. Very nice.D: An interesting, rewarding beer. A bit pricey, but worth it, I think. Heavy enough to let you know it means business, but light enough to be fun and drinkable. Definitely worth a try if you see one!Notes (from the brewery's website): This is a copy of an Export Stout (6.7% ABV, 78 IBU) brewed by Youngers of Edinburgh in 1897. Strongly hopped, well-balanced with luscious chocolate and cocoa flavours. There is a maltiness to the beer, which is not due to residual sugars. It was heavily hopped as befits an export beer and matured for many months so that the hops could mellow and contribute to the complexity of the beer.\n",

A dark tan, it tops a much darker brown beer, completely opaque. Good lacing. With this creamy monster of a head, occasional bubbles, and a richly-coloured impenetrable beer, appearances don't get much better than this.S: Chocolate and fruit. A slightly roasted character to the maltiness, akin to a porter, but slightly sweeter. Creamy.T: Odd, but good. The head is a bit disappointing, airier than anticipated, and slightly clinical in taste. However, the main body of the beer is dark, with waxy milk chocolate and mere traces of canned fruit.

Ah, well, we shan't judge a beer by its colour. S: Really nice. Great yeast, with an excellent sour note that reminds me of whisky wash. Some malty sweetness undergirds the whole thing.T: Shockingly good. This really hits the spot. Fruity and balanced. Touches of grape, green apple, pear, and raspberry. A zesty malt gives body, substance, and a hint of caramel. The endtaste is drying, bitter, and lightly sour. Excellently crafted!M: A beer of utmost poise and proportion.O: I have always been impressed with Luckie Ales, but the Minority Ale may take the cake. It's not obviously magnificent, but it is, perhaps, flawless. That is to say, everything is good and I can find nothing about which to complain (save perhaps an offputting feel to the drying aftertaste). Absolutely recommended, and I am setting out to purchase another as this review is submitted.Notes: &quot;This is a small beer (6.1% ABV, 23 IBU) produced from the second runnings of a batch of Majority Ale (produced by Younger's in 1937 at 12%+ ABV and 95 IBU). Majority Ale was never sold, but brewed on the birth of a director's heir, casked in oak for umpteen years and bottled to celebrate the heir's coming of age (21 years). The Minority Ale is not so grand but is still a superb pale amber beer, suitable for 'wetting the baby's head'.&quot;\n",

If it's not, you might not like it too much.

      "text_inp:  Poured from a 500mL bottle into a pint glass.A: The wacky label and odd pinkish tint of the brew through the bottle put me off a bit, but I was assured this was a &quot;great beer.&quot; It pours well -- crisp, clear medium-brown with light head and significant bubbles. No complaints so far.S: Floral hops give a nice topnote to fruiter undertones. Something about this smell rings a bell, but I can't quite put my finger on it -- is it the biscuit? I don't think so. I'm lost until I read the ingredients: Cascade hops (in addition to Styrian Golding). The pine, once recognised, is unmistakeable in the nose.T: This is way better than I expected it to be! Flavours are all mixed together -- bready, spicy, piney, hoppy, sweet. Very complex, very delicious. The hop character has a tendency to dominate overall, but perhaps that's because I'm now attuned to the Cascade hops. The aftertaste is dry, pleasant, but not overly long. After a long while there is the slightest hint of butterscotch.M: Mmm, hoppy, dry, carbonated, delicious.D: I wasn't lied to -- this is a great beer. One of the best I'd had in the country. Will drink again; absolutely recommended.Notes: An interesting bit of history, this beer was brewed in 2005 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the British victory in the Battle of Trafalgar. Allegedly, the King's messenger first stopped in a St. Austell tavern on his way to London to spread the news. Regardless of the veracity, this beer is worthy of such a glorific history.\n",

      "text_inp:  Poured from a 500mL bottle into a pint glass. Best before December 2010. A: Very nice! Ruddy dark-brown, with a thick, sturdy head. What appears at first glance to be a black beer is betrayed by soft edges. Held up to the light, one can just barely see shadows on the other side of the glass. Lacing clings to the sides. I approve!S: Sweet molasses-malt and equal amounts of springy hops.T: Almost sour fruit spars with the expected molasses, caramelised taste. Carbonation and hops are not far behind. Mostly malty in character, but disturbingly tart. The aftertaste is light, reflecting a diminished version of all the aforementioned flavours.M: Nothing notable -- some fizz, some spark. Meh.D: Alcohol is definitely noticeable, surprising considering the relatively low ABV. Not sure from whence the odd sourness comes, perhaps it's because I'm flirting with the Best Before date, maybe it's just the style. At any rate, it detracts from an otherwise pleasant ale. It is true winter outdoors (0° C and five inches of snow on the ground) and that does make this beer feel more appropriate. Based on this tasting, I can't recommend it.\n",

Little head on top of a clear, lustreless golden-hued beer.S: Very lovely. Hops and citrus. Bready maltiness. Floral honeysuckle. Wow.T: Hm. Strange, but tasty. An appley fruitiness draws unexpected first blood, before being blown away by piney hops. These, in turn, are backstabbed by a light honey which is then smothered by malt. After the dust settles, the aftertaste is inconclusive -- a collection of casualties from all camps of flavour. Some bitter-dry hops, some honey-wet malt. Although all the flavours are enjoyable, they don't quite balance, and none is dominant enough to characterise the taste. Odd, good, and with room for improvement.M: Substantial, chewy, and biscuity.

Soon thereafter, it turns somewhat tart and bitter. This smooths out into washy sort of maltiness before fading into a gently bitter-dry aftertaste. Although the beginning and end of the taste is pleasant, the bulk of the flavour is less than stellar.M: A bit metallic in feel (though not in taste), dry, and boring.D: A good beer, but not one I'd drink very often. I suppose the Goliath is suitable &quot;to slay a mighty thirst.&quot;\n",

      "text_inp:  Poured from a 500mL bottle into a pint glass.A: Medium-dark brown, light enough to see through the glass to my fingers, but dark enough to not be able to see beyond. Pitted head quickly collapses. I like the shape of the bottle.S: Very average. Maybe some malts, maybe not.T: Nice enough. Cold and malty, with a bitterness on the end that is very far from dry. The main taste is bit rough with some sourness. Aftertaste is clean. Even though this beer is on the bitter half of the spectrum, it doesn't quite taste of roasted malt.M: Lots of tingles, not just from carbonation, as well as an odd chilling effect. Even after sitting around for a while, this beer tastes colder than it should.D: Not special, but well-brewed. If you're out and about, you might as well grab one. I mean, it's called Hobgoblin with an axe-wielding, bow-and-arrow-toting example on the label. That said, I will probably never buy another one.\n",

      "text_inp:  Poured from a 500mL bottle into a pint glass.A: Clear mahogany with a nice finger of substantial head. A very pleasant shade of brown.S: Crisp malts have a heavy, if faint, alcoholic sweetness with a hint of hops.T: Quite nice. As you may expect, this is Wychwood's Hobgoblin amped up on steroids. Less bitter than its lesser kin, with more fruity maltiness, King Goblin still maintains a slight sour bent that seems somehow out of place. The aftertaste lingers, fully revealing the wonderful, balanced bitterness that was concealed in the main taste.M: Good! Carbonation is present, but not obviously so. The beer rolls easily around the mouth.D: I liked the King Goblin quite a bit. Perhaps the full moon really does add something to a beer. At 6.6% it's getting up there for an ESB, but the flavour is heightened as well. A great example of the style (and conforming very well to the style description - http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style/66/) and a beer that I would definitely drink again.Note: Apparently the first beer I've given straight 4's. Interesting, but in keeping with my experience with this beer. Everything was good; very little was either mediocre or excellent. Take this as you will.\n",

The label Wychcraft has been &quot;thrice hopped for flavour,&quot; but I find it overwhelmingly malty. The taste is smooth, full, and bitter only at the end.

Nice structure here, with good lacing clinging to the glass.Harken back to childhood memories of an elderly aunt who is cheap as the day is long. Remember her candy dish, and the cheap, shitty, oversweet fruit candy she had in it? That's the nose on this beer. It got 1.5 instead of 1.0 because I could identify the fruit as raspberry.We are lucky this isn't as bad as the nose. I actually tasted this a couple of ways, including holding my nose to avoid the aroma. OK -- raspberry fruit up front -- not fresh and tart, but more like boiled down or overcooked preserves (got it! -- like the semi-burnt preserve flavor you get in a jam-based baked dessert/cookie; that semi burnt edge that is both sweet and bitter) . There is enough bitterness behind this (in the beer) to offset the sweet a bit, and it fights thru so it seems like you just eaten some bitter raspberry seeds. Candied fruit fights its way back and finally (!) some natural fruit flavor begins to shine thru as the palate clears. Finish is more sweet than tart. 3.0? I'm feeling generous today (meaning, if I was drinking this outdoors I might have spit it on the lawn).Has some body and light carbonation. Probably could use a bit more in the bubble dept., but this is ok. Has a bit of an authentic acidic edge, which I do quite like.Ok, this is fruit beer, so I know what I was getting into. Don't hate this, but funny enough, the more I drink this, the less I like it (odd, as things usually grow on you). They went all-in with strength of flavor, which is good. Many brewers just wimp out and give you something weak and bad; here, it is strong and semi-bad. An A for effort.This stuff will never pass my lips again, nor will their other option (strawberry).

Toasted malt, some yeast, bread/toast up front with an immediate pop of hops. Resinous hops. Bitterness comes in and builds as the malt dissipates, leading to a long balanced and smooth bitter finish consisting of hops and brown bread crust. How nice is this?Medium bodied, good solid carbonation.I'm slowly learning that good English IPA means balance. Damn right. This has it all. Been staring at this one literally for years and never pulled the trigger because it is always $10-$12 for a 1 pint 9 oz bottle. Sometimes you need to pay a little to get something good. This is worth the price. Loved it.\n",

Some fruit and a touch of alcohol up front. As the alcohol in the palate clears, you get a hint of cherry, then this dries out to a fruit and nutty bitter brown bread crust finish. Surprising complexity here, even though it seems like it shouldn't be. What I don't like is that the flavors don't linger. Even the booze is quick.

Toasted malt, some mild fruit (pear?), a little caramel. The malt dries out a touch, perhaps a bit of biscuit. But it is the interwoven bitterness that makes this one work. Terrific balance in this department. The sweet and medium bitter play off each other well, and as the palate clears, the bitter becomes more dominant.

Lasting ring of foam with arcs of lace in the glass. Maintains some froth during the whole glass.Tart with a musty cellar funk to it.

Black body, it was dim in the bar, the candlelight did nothing for it. Very creamy foam, similar to a Guinness on nitro. It left a solid sheet of lacing down the opposite side I was drinking from. Compact head of foam with a creamy feel. Nose was mellow, possibly it was too cold, but didn't get much besides faint roast. The feel was light and creamy, almost a milk stout minus the sweetness. Dry unsweetened chocolate and tobacco. Thin bodied with a light creaminess. Miles ahead of Guinness, still fairly simple and sessionable.\n",

It pours into a tulip a really lovely ruby jewel tone, with a finger of offwhite foam (not flat, whew).

      "text_inp:  2008 vintage, (capped not corked) re-review. Seeing several positive reviews of this newer vintage made me curious enough to try it for comparison. Served at 50º cellar temp into a stemmed wine goblet. Looks fantastic, three fingers width of tan mocha foam, creamy surface texture, and copious lacing. Floating island of foam in the center. Skim never disappears, and the sticky lacing coats the glass. Doesn't even look like the same beer as the older corked bottles.Muted roasty aroma, notes of dry musty leather. A bit of dried berry and damp wood that suggests a Flanders Oud Bruin. Roasty, tangy flavor, carob, coffee, chocolate. Sea salt chocolate caramels. Very viscous and palate coating. Bare hint of Brett yeast adds a leathery quality. Very rich, dry and slightly bitter, not sweet. Luckily no off flavors of soy, cardboard, or oxidation as was prevalent in the earlier corked vintages. Actually looking forward to drinking the rest of this...*** 12-26-2007 review #500. B/3.62001 bottle smuggled from Kansas City in my luggage.The bottle and label remind me of some turn-of-the century esoteric &quot;wonder tonic&quot;. Pours pitch black, darker than molasses. Zero head, little to no carbonation, and oily in texture and appearance. Familiar aroma of musty, rich dark fruit, like black cherry soaking in port casks.Strong resemblance to a blending of De Dolle Oerbier &amp; Special Export Stout. Salty and fudgy, like chocolate yogurt covered pretzels. Carob and dried black cherry. There is a sour, tangy note, along with the salty/spicy, almost like olive brine, which is sure to make the less intrepid shudder. Beef jerky? Really at a loss for words at this point.It becomes more earthy and medicinal over time, developing clay and soy notes, slowing the sips down considerably. Alcohol starts to really burn through after half an hour. More than a little strange and left of center. It caught me off guard at first, and honestly became a little difficult to finish. However, it exists as a unique historical interpretation, and seems to be authentic in that aspect. Maybe this is what the Czars were sipping back in the day. Who knows...but it's certainly worth a try to the more adventurous seekers out there.***Edit: 2000 vintage tasting notesAgain, it pours completely still. Leather, raisin, prune aromas. Salty and smoky flavors that verge on jerky territory. Carob and faint cocoa make this tolerable. If you are still reading this, seek out a fresher sample. Sounds like the 2003 is still actually carbonated...i'll pick one up if I see it, and give this one last try.\n",

Not sure what the local distribution is like, but I haven't seen it at bigger stores yet. It pours into a pint glass a deep amber gold, a good layer of skim on top, with a string of pearls around the edges. A ring of lace forms after its sipped. Woody with a hint of tobacco at first, becoming fruity and vaguely floral later on, with hints of oxidation already. Something musty and odd is there, but it's hard to put a finger on. Joe says &quot;old man cologne&quot; which isn't that far off. Dry with a mild note of bready malt sweetness. Faded, muddled fruit. Dull and papery, signaling the onset of oxidation. Light bodied and mildly bitter, the odd notes in the flavor keep it from being sessionable. Hopefully it wasn't mistreated in the few short months it's been in the states, but as it is, I can't fully recommend this one.\n",

At only 0.5% ABV this qualifies as a low alcohol beer. Review from written notes. Served in a Liefmans flute, it poured a yellow gold, slightly orange at the top, and a paler shade of yellow at the meniscus of the glass. Carbonation trails raced through it, with some CO2 clinging to the sides, with spotty lacing. Head retention was actually decent, and not fizzy like soda. Lemon tonic water aroma, slight sweetness of lemonade. Authentic lemon juice citrus flavor, mildly sweet, with a pale malt aftertaste, and lingering lemon peel bitterness.

A swirl releases an echo of cobweb skim, but there is very little visible carbonation. There was a decent pop when the cork was pulled. Well oxidized aroma, old musty leather, tobacco, soil, and grapes. Flavor is rich and sweet, ye old fruity elixir. The hallmarks of age are here, but compliment rather than strike against it. Musty oxidation and pruney raisin fig sweetness. No hint at a high ABV. Imagine a mixed fruit flavored fruit roll up aged for a few years in a cellar, then distilled into an old ale.

A hybrid of the styles if you ask me. Smooth mouthfeel, would be improved if on cask, as it is at the Map Room on occasion. Sweet malt lingers in the aftertaste, but it's brief. Good drinkabiltity, will have to compare this to a cask sample.\n",

      "text_inp:  First of all, this is the furthest thing from an American IPA as you can get. Once expectations are out of the way, this ale presents many unique qualities. Definitely Brett in this one. This is my second pint in 2 days, and i'm really enjoying this stuff. It pours a hazy, tawny orange into a goblet-style glass. About 1/2 inch of foam fizzles up and settles to nothing, no lacing even. Looks like a cask ale in fact, and lo and behold, the label states it was cask aged 6 months before bottling. Aroma is fantastic. Musty citrus, wet hay, barnyard funk more akin to Gueuze, but nowhere near as sharp or sour. Orval may find a distant cousin in this unique English IPA. There's also a mildly cheesy, aged hop presence. Flavors of apricot, almond, and citrus rind. Toffee like malt, but only in texture and not sweetness. Dry and bitter finish. Fruitiness is very unique, in that it has a certain fullness and distinct apricot/persimmon taste. A mild underlying spice from the hops. Brett adds another distinctive facet of restrained wildness. Must be some funky casks that are used for aging!Smooth with low carbonation, mellow with mild bitterness in the finish. Easy to finish the bottle, but it must be savored. Cheers...EDIT 2008: 2 bottles I purchased in Madison weren't similar at all to my first review. Hoping they were just old, and that the funky spice shows up in future bottles. Edit #2: Hit or miss with this one, i've had one tasty one, and two so-so bottles from the same place, same purchase. Seems there's alot of variability with this, but i'll continue to drink it, because when it's good, it's a really captivating beer...pretty similar to Wild Devil.\n",

Malt is clearly evident in both aroma and taste, but not quite as rich or pronounced as the “full malt character” on the label might lead one to expect. Floral throughout, including the aftertaste, this beer leans towards sweet, which seems in keeping with the floral flavor profile. Still, it smells sweeter than it tastes.

Limited lacing.The aroma of chocolate clomes out loud and clear. Rather like hot chocolate without the extra dairy, and some chocolate nibs. Flavor: sweet, perhaps just a touch above optimum. Some dark roast (and light bitterness) in the aftertaste but largely masked by the chocolate before then.

Pours with a large, durable head that manages to be both kind of sudsy as well as creamy. Near black, opaque body. The head limits the aromatics.  After it settles a while, there's an appealing mix of roasted grains with toffee, dates and dark dried fruits.  The flavor carries a generous load of dark malts with faint smoke, no char, and some spicy hops.  Full and exceptionally smooth body with a near perfect carbonation level. Overall: rich and flavorful.  An excellent English porter that's up with Fuller's London Porter as among the best of the style.\n",

So, that's where the Samuel Smith &quot;The Famous&quot; Taddy Porter (in a brown bottle) came in.Appearance: Pours a black body with a creamy, light khaki-colored head. No lacing.Smell: Subtle aroma of toasted toffee with hints of chocolate, nuts, and a slight smokiness.Taste: A true medley of malt flavors with each sip - coffee, caramel, bittersweet chocolate, molasses. The finish has a soft, light hoppiness to it, but also carries with it a toasted sugar sweetness.Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Smooth, but a bit watery on the palate. Drinkability: For me, it could use just a bit more body, but perhaps the current recipe tested better with focus groups. So what do I know? Still, though, its a worthy English porter and exceedingly drinkable.\n",

Taste: Begins with a taste of sweet, luscious caramel with a deep, dark sugary tone to it along with some lightly toasty biscuit hints and a notable fruitiness coming across as raisins and dehydrated apricots ready for the trail mix bag. Mild spiciness and bitterness from the English hops. Only a minor perceived woody character seems to have been imparted by the oak staves. A bit mineral-laden on the back half.

This is nothing but Black and Red... good grief.Appearance: Pours out a dark amber body with a foamy, off-white head.Smell: Pleasing aroma of bread dough, honey, and caramel, with a few fruity notes as well. Taste: Essentially malty, with flavors of caramel, burnt sugar, and, to a lesser degree, golden raisins. Exceptionally light citrus hop flavor with an equally light hop bittneress that comes and goes fairly quickly. Ultimately, this beer finishes fairly sweet.Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, with a curiously flat mouthfeel.Drinkability: An enjoyable, eminently drinkable ESB.\n",

Some chocolate, vaguely coffee-like flavors within. A delectable roasted sweetness permeates every sip. A hint of licorice and vanilla as well, no questions there. Finishes with a very mild hop bitterness.Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, with just the right amount of carbonation. Notably smooth and creamy.Drinkability: Quite drinkable.

Plenty of alcohol notes, too.Taste: A very curious flavor; a mixture of light caramel, toasted pecans, a zesty Christmas spice, and hints of apples and pears. The hops, though minimal, are quite grassy tasting and lends a nice, dry finish. As with the nose, the alcohol is rather apparent, tasting like someone snuck in a shot of brandy in my glass.

No more than a few stray dots of lace on the way down.Smell: Faintly biscuit scented, that's all, as the sweet-scented honey is the main player here, as expected, though there's some subtle hints of florals and citrus, like sniffing an orange blossom honey.Taste: Sweet taste of raw honey overlaying lightly supporting mild-tasting biscuity, bready malts. Light floral notions. A kiss of citrus. Low hop character provides just a smidgen of spice and bitterness, letting the honey settle quietly on the tongue. Sweetish finish.Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation.Overall: Tastes like a glass of that Bit-O-Honey candy. Honey Dew is amply honey-tasting without being overly sweet.

      "text_inp:  Picked up a 550 ml bottle of this stuff at Giant Eagle (just started selling beer). That's roughly 1.5 beers at the 12 oz portion, which cost me $3.99. A legendary brewery's offering from England found its way into a supermarket in Pennsylvania. Translation: I'm not complaining.The beer is black, unsurprisingly. An outstanding beige head with beautiful, fluffy lacing hangs out in my nonic pint glass.Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout smells of alcohol, tart fruit (indistinguishable, but I know it's present) with biscuity notes; even cookie dough.The taste/mouthfeel is soft &amp; delicate, but dark &amp; toasty. One of the attributes that I find so incredible about stouts is their ability to carry a high number of IBU's (International Bittering Units) without the senses realizing it. I'm guessing there are 70-80 IBU's in this brew, but the dark quality of the style hides the quantity, rendering it at about half that estimate to ones sense of taste.The beer is very buttery (diacetyl), but the more negative aspect of that byproduct doesn't seem to make it to the front. I have no qualms with its position in the beer. As far as I'm concerned, it knows where it stands, and doesn't get in the way like it tends to in certain English Pale Ales.This one I certainly recommend. Sooner or later I'll get to the Nut Brown Ale...\n",

      "text_inp:  I poured my bottles into a 16 oz mug.This is my review originally posted @ http://thelightonbeer.blogspot.com -My buddy has been telling me for a few weeks now about Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. So, when I saw it at my local six-pack shop, I had to buy a few.The two singles I bought were somewhere around $3.50 each, give or take a few dimes. They're bottled with a touch of class, with golden foil around the head and on top of the cap. The presentation just about matches the quality of the product, with the beer coming out on top.Honestly, I don't know much about stouts, nor do I throw them down very often. My previous experiences with stouts involved Guinness (naturally) and some stout brew from Troegs, the exact name I can't remember. To take that back without using the backspace, this past fall I had some sort of double chocolate stout in a purple can, either 16 or 24 oz's (I enjoyed it out of a friend's fridge). I just saw it in the store last night...ahhh...I typed it in Google and found a picture. The brew is made from Young's. Moving on:I poured the Oatmeal Stout by Samuel Smith (England) in my 16 oz mug (at least I think it's a 16 oz mug) using the straight down the middle pour that I'm under the impression goes without saying when dealing with a stout. I got a really nice head out of the bottle, and the smell is very nice. The head retention is remarkable. Mind you, I'm continuously swirling, but I'm about halfway through the beer and after letting the beer sit for over a minute, I've still got half an inch of head that is showing no signs of disappearing.The taste is excellent. It offers flavor like a smoked beer (minus the salty beef jerky taste that I can't stand), roasted malts, black coffee, burnt caramel, with a balance that is stronger than any amount of bitterness that would show up, depending on the palate. Considering some of the stronger elements to this beer, it is pretty incredible that it fails to make me want to gag.After enjoying two Oatmeal Stout singles from Samuel Smith, I not only am going to try another brew from Samuel Smith's Old Brewery, I'm going to explore more in the world of stouts.\n",

The bottle is fancy as well with the brewery name embossed above the stomach, say the chest of the bottle. It's been 20 minutes. This beer is calling me...Almost pitch black with translucent mahogany-brown shades near the bottom. A cola-beige head sits atop, fluffy and incredible. Smells of deeply rich malts, dark chocolate, prunes, figs, burnt brown sugar, moist raw cane sugar, and butter (baby). LATE ADDITION UPDATE: as it warms, a friendly boozy note.Taste is so approachable it makes me want to ask every bartender in town to serve this on-tap. Who am I kidding? Back to reality (and oh my am I enjoying it)...bittering hops afloat a hefty dark malt bill. Creamy, but more than enough hops to shake things up; I'd say the ideal amount.The body is medium to heavy or somewhere between an early Roy Jones, Jr. and a Larry Holmes in his prime (my pops will like that one, that is if he reads this blog).I'm relishing the fact that I've still got another 8 ozs or so left to enjoy. I need time alone with this one. Cheers!Notes: this one is reminiscent of Guinness Extra Stout, and that is certainly a good thing.\n",

My initial response to the smell and taste of a drop from the mouth of the bottle after pouring it into my mug was &quot;Ughhh....frat-house beer.&quot; After a thorough taste though, not so much.Whitbread Pale Ale smells of sweet malts, is amber/copper in color, and pours out a nice white head with a semi-creamy, semi-thin lacing. Head retention is very good. I don't know the number, but the IBU (International Bitterness Unit) is probably low to mid-range.There is definitely a bready character that talks to the palate, kind of like a sourdough. The body is a nice medium. There seems to be more of a focus on malted barley than a focus on hops, but the ratio is agreeable. The hops that do come out really shine in the feel of the beer, while adding just enough bitterness to the taste.In addition, as a Yuengling Traditional Lager drinker, I appreciate Whitbread Pale Ale. It shares some of Yuengling Traditional's characteristics in smell and body. Yuengling fans will not be disappointed with this one from the late Sam Whitbread.Without a doubt, Whitbread Pale Ale is a solid &quot;session&quot; beer. Give this one a try.\n",

I saw there must be even better beers than my favorites so I wrote down the A and A+ beers. Most A+ beers are hard to find, but I found a few A's. The first one I tried is Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. I'm not the biggest fan of this style. It is a little plane for me, but I want to give it a fair review compared to other nut browns I've had that include Troeg's and New Castle. I'm gonna grade this better than New Castle but slightly under Troeg's. I am a little biased towards Troeg's however.A- Beautiful dark copper caramel color. When I first poured it there was a nice foamy, soft head. The head was a little thick for my taste, but still nice. The foam clung to the glass nicely with each sip.S- Nutty is a good description of this beer. I smell a slight pecan and hazelnut with toffee undertones. T- Very clean. The bottle describes it as dry and that would be a good description. However, there is an aftertaste almost porter like on the breath. A slight bitterness with a coffee undertone. A little watery for my taste. The more you drink it the more complex it becomes, but I wouldn't describe it as a complex tasting beer overall.M- Smooth but with a creaminess left over. Like whip cream, it leaves a pleasant filminess. The bitterness dries the mouth a bit.Drinkability. Very easy to drink. Goes great with a burger or steak. No harsh alcohol taste.

The aroma is of toasted malts, nuts, clean hops and just enough of a sour punch to let me know that is what it is. Smooth medium body.The taste also has a yeasty, biscuity note more so than the sour.  There is a light pucker-up character to it but that's the way sours are. Sours are usually low on my list I go looking beers but this one is more approachable for me.  But a tad pricey where I bought it.\n",

Sampled on May 21, 2014.Slightly hazy pale yellow pour building up to a full, creamy white head that slowly settles down but never disappears entirely.The nose is quite mild for an Imperial IPA. I expected explosive hops but instead they are more subtle and they balance well with the roasted malts. There is also a kind of melon note.Light body.The malts express themselves more than the hops considering this is an Imperial IPA. It would not bother me as much if this was a standard English style IPA. I shouldn't say it bothers me. It was not what I anticipated. Malts mix in well. Hops linger a little at the end. I did enjoy it but I was expecting more hop bitterness.\n",
